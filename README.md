[![CircleCI](https://circleci.com/gh/Ajay233/react_redux_front_end.svg?style=svg)](https://circleci.com/gh/Ajay233/react_redux_front_end)

## Background

This app has been created as a practice project to trial the use of React and Redux to build a front end app.  The front end app links to a back end API app that serves the front end.  

## Running the app

In the project directory, simply run:

### `npm start`

This will run the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

## Technology used

- React
- Redux
- Redux thunk
- Redux forms
- Axios (for making network requests)
- Jest
- Enzyme

I have also made use of CircleCI for continuous integration.  The build badge can be seen above at the top of this README indicating the current build status.
